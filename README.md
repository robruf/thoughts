thoughts - Social media app where people can share whatever they're thinking.

Beta stable(?) version - 0.1

The app is still incomplete and it can't be considered a finished project yet.
However, major features have been implemented and its basic functionalities can be used.

Login can be done through Google.

New features and styling to be implemented in upcoming release(s) - check TODO file for more info.

Technologies/frameworks involved:

    Back-end: Node.JS, Express.JS, Passport.JS
    Database: MongoDB
    Front end: Bootstrap 4 and a very little JQuery

NOTE: package.json might contain unused dependencies - this is due to the app being currently under development
